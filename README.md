# Speech Segmentation Toolkit: Voice Activity & Silence Detection in Audio

This project provides a practical toolkit for segmenting speech and silence within audio files using signal processing techniques. It includes:
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Uses short-time energy thresholding to identify active speech segments in .wav audio.
- Silence Detection: Implements silence period identification by analyzing low-energy frames or gaps between speech bursts.
- Visualization: Clear waveform visualizations showing detected speech and silence boundaries.
- Modular Structure: Functions are written for reusability and can be easily integrated into real-time speech processing pipelines or preprocessing stages for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems.
